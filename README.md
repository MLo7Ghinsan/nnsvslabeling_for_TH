A fork of @UtaUtaUtau's nnsvslabeling to be used with TH phonemes

# How to Use
### Dependency

Python ofc

### lab2ust

The whole lab2ust folder will be put in the UTAU plugins folder.

This will only directly translate timing according to the BPM of the UST. It puts all notes at middle C (C4).

TBH just do 60 for quantization
